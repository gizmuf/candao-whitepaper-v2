# Community-Built Apps (App Factory Model)

**Replace:** Traditional dev agencies, venture-funded startups

---

## Before
- Building an app requires large upfront capital
- Founders move slowly or die before product-market fit
- Dev costs dominate early budget

## With Candao
- Partners commit to Zero Fee + alignment bond ($1,000+ CDO)
- 360° community contributes: build, design, market, operate
- AI acceleration reduces cost and time-to-market

## Why Users Join
- They're not "users" — they're participants in what they use
- Better products built by aligned communities

## Why Partners Win
- Lower capex + faster iteration + growth-based rewards
- Community becomes an engine, not an audience

## 💰 The Numbers

**Build faster at lower cost — community execution vs. $50k+ agency fees.**
