# Initial Ownership Offerings (IOOs)

**Replace:** Traditional fundraising, VC equity rounds

---

## Before
- Fundraising is slow, gatekept, and equity-heavy
- Contributors get no ownership
- Communities are used, not rewarded

## With Candao
- Ventures tokenize participation and ownership rights
- Contributors gain upside aligned with execution
- Ghosts coordinate updates, milestones, and governance workflows
- AI Ghosts manage operations, DAOs govern decisions

## Why Users Join
- Contributions become valuable and recognized
- Ownership, not just participation

## Why Partners Win
- Community becomes an engine — not an audience
- Token-aligned growth incentives

---

## 💰 The Numbers

**Contributors earn ownership — not just thank-you emails.**

## Example

A neighborhood solar cooperative — residents invest in shared panels, AI Ghost optimizes energy distribution, profits flow back to token holders.
