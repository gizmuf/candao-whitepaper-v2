## The Big Picture: One Identity, Infinite Use

A user enters through one app…  
but gains access to a growing ecosystem.

A partner builds one business…  
but gains a 360° community of roles:
builders, creators, marketers, operators, sales, logistics, advisors, and more.

This is how Candao becomes a movement:
**no rent extraction, ownership, contribution, rewards.**
