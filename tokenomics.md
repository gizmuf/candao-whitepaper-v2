## Token Utility

### 1. Zero Fee Access Key
Token holding (not spending) unlocks ecosystem access:

| Tier | Hold Value | Access |
|------|------------|--------|
| Free | $0 | Basic Ghost |
| Standard | $100 | Full Ghost |
| Premium | $1,000 | Partner program |
| Elite | $10,000 | Enterprise features |

### 2. Ecosystem Fuel
Small fees for:
- On-chain profile claims
- IOO minting
- Ghost transaction processing
- Premium features

### 3. Governance
Expertise-weighted voting:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Token holdings | 40% |
| Domain expertise | 30% |
| Contribution history | 20% |
| Time in ecosystem | 10% |

**Governance Scope & Limitations:**

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|-------------|
| Protocol parameters (fees, limits) | Day-to-day operations |
| Treasury allocation guidelines | Individual investment decisions |
| Roadmap priorities | Partner selection |
| Tokenomics adjustments | Legal/compliance matters |

> **Important:** Governance controls the *protocol*, not the *foundation*. Foundation operations remain legally compliant and professionally managed.

## Buyback & Make Strategy

**No token burning.** All revenue:
1. Converts to $CDO on open market
2. Redistributes to ecosystem participants
3. Creates continuous buying pressure

**Guardrails:**

| Parameter | Constraint |
|-----------|------------|
| Max buyback per cycle | 5% of treasury |
| Frequency | Monthly |
| Distribution | Pro-rata to stakers/LPs |
| Emergency pause | DAO vote (48h timelock) |
| Audit | Quarterly third-party verification |

| Treasury | 20% | DAO-controlled |
| Public Sale | 15% | 20% TGE, 12mo vest |
| Private Sale | 10% | 12mo cliff, 24mo vest |
