## Token Utility

### 1. Zero Fee Access Key
Token holding (not spending) unlocks ecosystem access:

| Tier | Hold Value | Access |
|------|------------|--------|
| Free | $0 | Basic Ghost |
| Standard | $100 | Full Ghost |
| Premium | $1,000+ | Partner program |
| Elite | $10,000 | Enterprise features |

### Token Lock (Users & Partners)

> **Note:** This section covers **Zero Fee access locks** — tokens held to unlock ecosystem access. These are separate from investor/team vesting schedules shown in Token Distribution below.

Tokens held for ecosystem access are **locked** with gradual unlock:

| Year | Unlock | Cumulative Liquid | Status |
|------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | 0% | 0% | Fully locked |
| 2 | 10% | 10% | 90% locked |
| 3 | 10% | 20% | 80% locked |
| 4 | 40% | 60% | 40% locked |
| 5 | 40% | 100% | Fully liquid |

**Why Token Lock?**
- **Removes CDO from circulation** → healthier tokenomics
- **Zero-fee access continues** throughout lock period
- **Users become stakeholders** → long-term ecosystem alignment
- **Predictable supply** → sustainable growth dynamics

> **Important:** Token Lock is a *commitment*, not a penalty. You keep your tokens — they just unlock gradually. Access to all Zero Fee services continues from Day 1.

See [How Partners Earn](how-partners-earn.md#token-lock-schedule) for detailed unlock mechanics and potential future dynamic unlock features.

### 2. Ecosystem Fuel
Small fees for:
- On-chain profile claims
- IOO minting
- Ghost transaction processing
- Premium features

### 3. Governance
Expertise-weighted voting:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Token holdings | 40% |
| Domain expertise | 30% |
| Contribution history | 20% |
| Time in ecosystem | 10% |

**Governance Scope & Limitations:**

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|-------------|
| Protocol parameters (fees, limits) | Day-to-day operations |
| Treasury allocation guidelines | Individual investment decisions |
| Roadmap priorities | Partner selection |
| Tokenomics adjustments | Legal/compliance matters |

> **Important:** Governance controls the *protocol*, not the *foundation*. Foundation operations remain legally compliant and professionally managed.
