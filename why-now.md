## The Moment Before the Shift

Imagine reading this in 2030:

> *"Remember when we used to pay Airbnb 20%? When Upwork took a cut of every invoice? When we didn't own our data, and AI agents were just lab demos?"*

**That world is ending.** The tools to replace it exist today. Candao is the execution layer that makes the Zero Fee Economy real.
