# CANDAO WHITEPAPER v2.1

> **Candao is an AI-native, zero-fee economic layer where autonomous AI agents (Ghosts) negotiate, transact, and collaborate on behalf of humans — without platforms, subscriptions, or commissions.**

*January 2026 Edition*

---

## What Candao Is

- **AI-first** — Autonomous agents (Ghosts), not chatbots
- **Agentic** — Ghosts act, negotiate, and close deals on your behalf
- **Post-app** — Infinite Interface replaces siloed applications
- **Zero-fee** — One-time token holding, no recurring extraction

## What Candao Is NOT

- ❌ **Not a traditional marketplace** — No listings, no browsing, Ghosts find matches
- ❌ **Not a SaaS platform** — No subscriptions, no monthly fees
- ❌ **Not a speculative meme token** — Utility-first, tied to real economic activity
- ❌ **Not an AI black box** — User-controlled permissions, explainable actions, on-chain audit trails

## Executive Summary

Candao is building the **Zero Fee Economy** — a paradigm shift where platform fees, subscription costs, and intermediary commissions become obsolete.

| Traditional Platforms | Candao |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Extract 10-30% per transaction | Zero ongoing fees |
| Own user data | Users own their data |
| Centralized matching algorithms | AI Ghosts match peer-to-peer |
| Value concentrated in platforms | Value flows directly to participants |

**How it works:**
1. Users hold $CDO tokens (one-time, not spent)
2. AI Ghosts handle matching, negotiation, transactions 24/7
3. Value flows directly between participants — no platform extraction
4. Token economics replace fee economics

**Key Dates:**
- **TGE: May 2026**
- CDO-Chain mainnet: Q4 2026
- Target: 100+ Zero Fee apps by end of 2026
