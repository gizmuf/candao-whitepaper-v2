# How Partners Earn

## The Core Shift

Most apps monetize by taking **fees** from every transaction.

Candao flips this:

**The app owner commits to Zero Fee** and instead earns through:

1. **CDO-aligned rewards** — A CDO pool linked to app growth
2. **Utility-driven demand exposure** — CDO is required for access, so adoption growth may increase demand (no guarantees)
3. **Direct revenue** — Selling products/services directly (not taxing the marketplace)
4. **Reduced costs** — Community-powered building reduces development expenses

> **Instead of extracting from users, you grow the ecosystem and are rewarded for creating real value.**

## Partner Entry: The $1,000+ CDO Commitment

A business owner enters by holding:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **CDO Commitment** | $1,000+ worth (varies by partner/business scope) |
| **Purpose** | Alignment bond, not a fee |
| **Commitment** | Zero Fee operation model |
| **Mission** | Onboard users into the ecosystem |

This is not a cost. It's a **commitment bond** that aligns the owner with the protocol.

## What Partners Receive

### 1. Apps Built by the 360° Community

Instead of paying agency rates, partners get apps built through the ecosystem:

- **AI-accelerated development** (getting stronger monthly)
- **Multirole contributors** (devs, designers, marketers, operators)
- **Production-ready delivery** at massively reduced cost

Contributors earn through community reward mechanisms.

### 2. Happier Customers Through Lower Prices

Because the business commits to **Zero Fee**:

- Customers pay less (no middleman tax)
- Higher perceived value per dollar
- Better retention and loyalty

### 3. The CDO Demand Flywheel

Partners buy CDO early, then drive demand by onboarding users:

```
Partner buys CDO → Builds app → Users need CDO to join
       ↑                              ↓
       └──── Demand increases ←───────┘
```

As more users join:
- Demand for CDO increases
- Protocol becomes stronger
- Partners benefit from utility-driven growth

### 4. CDO Reward Pool Replaces Fee Profit

Instead of earning through fees, partners earn through **reward pools**:

| Your Contribution | Your Reward |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Users onboarded | CDO allocation |
| App activity | Pool share |
| Network growth | Bonus rewards |

> **Value created for the network → rewards returned to the creator.**

---

## The Partner Reward Formula

> **More active users + better retention = larger share of the protocol rewards.**

### Reward Distribution (Per Epoch)

Reward pool distribution per epoch (month/quarter):

$$
\text{Reward}_i(t) = \text{Pool}(t) \times \frac{\text{Score}_i(t)}{\sum_j \text{Score}_j(t)}
$$

Where:
- **Pool(t)** = Total CDO allocated for partner rewards in epoch t (governance-defined)
- **Score_i(t)** = Partner i's contribution score
- **Σⱼ Score_j(t)** = Sum of all partner scores (normalization)

### Partner Score Calculation

$$
\text{Score}_i = w_u \cdot f(\text{MAU}_i) + w_r \cdot \text{Retention}_{30} + w_x \cdot \text{CrossAppActivation} - w_s \cdot \text{SybilRisk}
$$

Where:
- **MAU** = Monthly Active Users (verified / anti-bot)
- **Retention₃₀** = % of users still active after 30 days
- **CrossAppActivation** = users who adopt other Zero Fee apps (network contribution)
- **SybilRisk** = anti-fraud penalty (prevents "fake users" gaming)

### Fairness Function

To prevent monopolistic concentration, MAU uses a **concave function**:

$$
f(\text{MAU}) = \log(1 + \text{MAU})
$$

This ensures large apps still win, but not infinitely — giving smaller quality apps a fair chance.

### Example Reward Distribution (Illustrative)

| Partner | MAU | Retention | Score | Pool Share |
|---------|-----|-----------|-------|------------|
| Small app | 500 | 85% | 6.2 | ~2% |
| Medium app | 5,000 | 70% | 8.5 | ~10% |
| Large app | 50,000 | 60% | 10.8 | ~25% |

> **Partners don't profit by taxing users. Partners profit by growing the network.**

## Anti-Gaming Protections

The protocol includes safeguards against manipulation:

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Sybil Detection** | On-chain identity/reputation, rate limiting |
| **Bot Prevention** | Behavioral analysis, anomaly detection |
| **Fake User Penalty** | SybilRisk score reduces partner rewards |
| **Optional Attestations** | Jurisdiction-dependent identity verification |

Partners caught gaming the system face:
- Immediate reward suspension
- Reputation score damage
- Potential removal from program

## Partner Commitments

| You Commit | You Receive |
|------------|-------------|
| Hold $1,000+ CDO (alignment bond) | App built by 360° community |
| Operate Zero Fee (no platform cuts) | Share of protocol reward pool |
| Onboard users to Infinite Package | Utility-driven demand exposure |
| Introduce partner candidates (optional) | Ecosystem expansion bonuses (governance-defined) |

## Important Disclaimers

> ⚠️ **This is not investment advice.**
>
> - Reward pool size is governance-defined and may change
> - Token prices fluctuate; past performance ≠ future results
> - Examples are **illustrative only**, not guaranteed outcomes
> - Partners earn through **protocol participation**, not token appreciation promises

## The Infinite Package for Users

Users enter through:

| Package | Cost | Access |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Infinite** | $100 CDO | Unlimited zero-fee access to participating Candao apps* |

> *Excludes external hard costs: AI compute, payment rails, shipping, third-party services.

Users aren't buying access to *one app*.

They're buying access to an **expanding universe of apps** on the same protocol.

### Why Users Keep Coming Back

- **Today:** Access to their entry app
- **Tomorrow:** Dozens more apps
- **Future:** Identity, reputation, rewards, relationships travel everywhere

One identity, many services, shared network value.

## The Critical Clarification

> **"Zero Fee doesn't mean no revenue. It means we remove rent extraction and replace it with network-aligned rewards and direct value creation."**

This is not charity. This is an **engineered economic system** where:

- Users pay less
- Partners earn through growth, not extraction
- Everyone benefits from network effects
- Value stays in the ecosystem

---

## Summary for Partners

| Instead of... | You get... |
|---------------|------------|
| Paying dev agencies | Community-built apps |
| Charging platform fees | CDO reward pools |
| Fighting for users | Shared ecosystem growth |
| Isolated app silos | Multi-app network effects |

**You convert your app to Zero Fee.**  
**You commit $1,000+ CDO as your alignment key.**  
**As your user base grows, you receive CDO rewards — replacing fee-based profits.**  
**Users benefit from lower prices AND access to an expanding ecosystem.**

The whole system grows as a movement: no rent extraction, ownership, contribution, rewards.
