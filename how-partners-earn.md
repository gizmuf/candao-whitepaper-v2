# How Partners Earn

## The Core Shift

Most apps monetize by taking **fees** from every transaction.

Candao flips this:

**The app owner commits to Zero Fee** and instead earns through:

1. **CDO-aligned rewards** — A CDO pool linked to app growth
2. **Token appreciation** — Demand created by onboarding users drives utility value
3. **Direct revenue** — Selling products/services directly (not taxing the marketplace)
4. **Reduced costs** — Community-powered building reduces development expenses

> **Instead of extracting from users, you grow the ecosystem and are rewarded for creating real value.**

## Partner Entry: The $1,000 CDO Commitment

A business owner enters by holding:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **CDO Commitment** | $1,000 worth (~10,000 CDO at $0.10) |
| **Purpose** | Alignment bond, not a fee |
| **Commitment** | Zero Fee operation model |
| **Mission** | Onboard users into the ecosystem |

This is not a cost. It's a **commitment bond** that aligns the owner with the protocol.

## What Partners Receive

### 1. Apps Built by the 360° Community

Instead of paying agency rates, partners get apps built through the ecosystem:

- **AI-accelerated development** (getting stronger monthly)
- **Multirole contributors** (devs, designers, marketers, operators)
- **Production-ready delivery** at massively reduced cost

Contributors earn through community reward mechanisms.

### 2. Happier Customers Through Lower Prices

Because the business commits to **Zero Fee**:

- Customers pay less (no middleman tax)
- Higher perceived value per dollar
- Better retention and loyalty

### 3. The CDO Demand Flywheel

Partners buy CDO early, then drive demand by onboarding users:

```
Partner buys CDO → Builds app → Users need CDO to join
       ↑                              ↓
       └──── Demand increases ←───────┘
```

As more users join:
- Demand for CDO increases
- Protocol becomes stronger
- Partners benefit from utility-driven growth

### 4. CDO Reward Pool Replaces Fee Profit

Instead of earning through fees, partners earn through **reward pools**:

| Your Contribution | Your Reward |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Users onboarded | CDO allocation |
| App activity | Pool share |
| Network growth | Bonus rewards |

> **Value created for the network → rewards returned to the creator.**

---

## The Partner Reward Formula

Your earnings are directly proportional to your contribution to the network:

**Monthly CDO Rewards = f(Active Users × Engagement × Network Growth)**

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Active Users** | More users in your app = larger share of reward pool |
| **Engagement** | Better app = higher retention = sustained rewards |
| **Network Growth** | Users you bring who join other apps = bonus multiplier |

> **The better your app, the more users you keep, the more you earn.**
>
> This is not charity. This is **performance-based protocol economics**.

### Example Reward Distribution

| Partner | Monthly Active Users | Reward Pool Share |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Small app | 500 | 0.5% |
| Medium app | 5,000 | 5% |
| Large app | 50,000 | 25% |

**Key insight:** The protocol rewards builders who create value — not middlemen who extract it. Your profitability comes from building a great product that users love, not from taking a cut of their transactions.

## The Infinite Package for Users

Users enter through:

| Package | Cost | Access |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Infinite** | $100 CDO | Unlimited usage across all Zero Fee apps |

Users aren't buying access to *one app*.

They're buying access to an **expanding universe of apps** on the same protocol.

### Why Users Keep Coming Back

- **Today:** Access to their entry app
- **Tomorrow:** Dozens more apps
- **Future:** Identity, reputation, rewards, relationships travel everywhere

One identity, many services, shared network value.

## The Critical Clarification

> **"Zero Fee doesn't mean no revenue. It means we remove rent extraction and replace it with network-aligned rewards and direct value creation."**

This is not charity. This is an **engineered economic system** where:

- Users pay less
- Partners earn through growth, not extraction
- Everyone benefits from network effects
- Value stays in the ecosystem

---

## Summary for Partners

| Instead of... | You get... |
|---------------|------------|
| Paying dev agencies | Community-built apps |
| Charging platform fees | CDO reward pools |
| Fighting for users | Shared ecosystem growth |
| Isolated app silos | Multi-app network effects |

**You convert your app to Zero Fee.**  
**You commit $1,000 CDO as your alignment key.**  
**As your user base grows, you receive CDO rewards — replacing fee-based profits.**  
**Users benefit from lower prices AND access to an expanding ecosystem.**

The whole system grows as a movement: no rent extraction, ownership, contribution, rewards.
