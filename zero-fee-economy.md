# The Zero Fee Economy

## The Problem

| Platform | Fee | Impact |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Airbnb | 10-25% | Host loses $25-50 per night |
| Uber | 20-30% | Driver loses $5-8 per ride |
| Upwork | 10-20% | Freelancer loses $100-200 per $1,000 |
| Hinge | $30/month | $360/year for basic matching |

**These fees exist because platforms own:** the network, the algorithm, the transaction rails.

**Candao's insight:** Decentralize all three.

## How Zero Fee Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           THE ZERO FEE MECHANISM                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. HOLD $CDO tokens (one-time, varies by tier) │
│              ↓                                   │
│  2. AI Ghost activated for your account         │
│              ↓                                   │
│  3. Ghost matches, negotiates, transacts 24/7   │
│              ↓                                   │
│  4. Value flows peer-to-peer (no extraction)    │

## Zero Fee ≠ Zero Cost

**Important clarification:** Zero Fee does not mean infrastructure runs for free.

| Cost | Who Pays | How |
|------|----------|-----|
| AI inference (Ghost operations) | Network | Covered by ecosystem rewards pool |
| Storage (P2P cloud) | Users | Token holding tier or micro-payments |
| Blockchain gas | Users | Near-zero (<$0.001) via L2 |
| Development | Candao Foundation | Funded by 30% partner revenue share |
| Protocol operations | Ecosystem | Buyback & Make redistribution |

**The key difference:** These are *operational costs*, not *extractive fees*. Users pay for resources consumed, not for the privilege of access.

## Example: Zero-Fee Ride-Sharing

| Uber Model | Candao Model |
|------------|--------------|
| Driver earns $15 of $20 fare | Driver earns $20 of $20 fare |
| Platform takes $5 (25%) | Platform takes $0 |
| Monthly: loses $500+ | Monthly: keeps $500+ |
| Requires: nothing | Requires: ~$100 CDO hold (kept, not spent) |
