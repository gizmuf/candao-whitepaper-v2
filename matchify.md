# Matchify Integration

**Matchify** is the flagship application built on Candao infrastructure — an AI-powered social commerce network implementing Ghost-to-Ghost matching at scale.

## The Infinite Interface

Traditional apps fragment your identity:
- LinkedIn (professional)
- Tinder (dating)
- Airbnb (travel)
- Uber (mobility)
- Upwork (work)

**Matchify vision:** One Ghost, one identity, infinite use cases.

Your Ghost handles all intents through natural conversation:
- "Find me a co-founder with ML experience"
- "I need a ride to the airport at 6am"
- "Match me with investors interested in Web3"
- "Open for coffee with creatives nearby"

## Sector Disruption

| Sector | Incumbent | Matchify Alternative |

| Mobility | Uber (25-30%) | Ghost-matched rides, 0% fee |
| Freelance | Upwork (10-20%) | Ghost-negotiated contracts, 0% fee |
| Dating | Hinge ($30/mo) | Token hold, unlimited matching |
| Commerce | Amazon (5-15%) | P2P transactions, 0% fee |

## Real-World Signals
