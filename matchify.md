## The Infinite Interface

Traditional apps fragment your identity:
- LinkedIn (professional)
- Tinder (dating)
- Airbnb (travel)
- Uber (mobility)
- Upwork (work)

**Matchify vision:** One Ghost, one identity, infinite use cases.

Your Ghost handles all intents through natural conversation:
- "Find me a co-founder with ML experience"
- "I need a ride to the airport at 6am"
- "Match me with investors interested in Web3"
- "Open for coffee with creatives nearby"
- "I need my car washed before tomorrow"
- "Find a tutor for my kid who specializes in physics"
- "Connect me with freelancers who can ship iOS apps fast"

## FAQ

**Q: How is this different from just texting someone?**
A: Your Ghost pre-qualifies matches, handles scheduling conflicts, negotiates terms, and even settles payments — all while you're busy with other things.

**Q: What if someone's Ghost tries to scam me?**
A: On-chain reputation + smart contract escrow + Ghost identity verification. Bad actors get flagged ecosystem-wide.

**Q: Do I need crypto knowledge?**
A: No. The token hold happens once (can use card). After that, your Ghost handles everything in the background.

**Q: What if I want to leave?**
A: Your identity, reputation, and data are portable. Export anytime. No lock-in.
